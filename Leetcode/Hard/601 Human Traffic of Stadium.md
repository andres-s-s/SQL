## 📝 Problem 📝 

Instructions:

Write a solution to display the records with three or more rows with consecutive id's, 
and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by visit_date in ascending order.

### ➡️ Solution 1  

**MySQL**,  **PostgreSQL**, **MS SQL Server**

~~~sql

  select 
      s.id
    , s.visit_date
    , s.people
    , case
        when
          lag(id) over(order by id ) + 1 
          =
          id
        then
          0
        else
          1
      end
        as t_f


  from 
      Stadium s

  where
      s.people >= 100
)

, grouped_sequences as (

  select
      f.id
    , f.visit_date
    , f.people
    , sum(t_f) over(order by f.id)

)


select 
    id

### ➡️ Solution 2    

**MySQL**,  **PostgreSQL**, **MS SQL Server**

~~~sql

### ➡️ Solution 3  

**MySQL**,  **PostgreSQL**, **MS SQL Server**

/* 
  If that id does not have 2 previous consecutive ids 
  or 2 following consecutive ids
